Calibrating a digital camera for computer vision 

The aim of this project is to illustrate the use of optimization to build a real-world model of a camera suitable for use in Computer Vision. Suppose that you wish to use a digital camera (be it a video or still camera, or even a mobile phone) to record images of objects and to measure some of the object's features reasonably accurately. You will need some way to characterise the measuring tool (your camera) so that any measurements can be used properly.
Calibration is only really suitable for  xed focus cameras, as varying the focus changes the important physical parameters that you need to capture. So we are going to assume that you have turned o  the auto-focus of your camera and you are not changing the zoom setting. Your task is to write a simple calibration package for your camera.
